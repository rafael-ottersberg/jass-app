# Description
My first attempt messing around with web development :).
This is a online game implementation of the swiss traditional game "Jass" developed during the Covid pandemic to continue playing our weekly tournament, including the special game mode "Sidi Barrani".
This app does not scale for multiple sessions at the moment and the game is only stored in RAM of the server.

The frontend is programmed with React, the backend with the game logic in Python/Flask.

The Webapp scales well on PCs and mobile phones.
